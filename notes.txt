* HLT-like MET collections:
  - started from HLT-like particleFlow collection provided by TSG (S. Gennai)
  - used it to create PF-MET, PF-MET-Type1, Puppi-MET and Puppi-MET-Type1 with standard offline EDProducers (e.g. PFMETProducer)

* compared to GEN (genMetTrue) and offline (slimmedMETs and slimmedMETsPuppi collections from corresponding MINIAODSIM samples)

* re-ran hlt-like reconstruction on Phase-2 RAW samples

* 3 MC samples considered: VBF_HiggsToInvisible_{NoPU, PU140, PU200}

* no event selection applied
